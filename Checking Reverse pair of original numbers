#3) You have an array of length N which have some two digit numbers in it. Each number is only occurring once. You have to find out count of those numbers which have their reverse number present.


def reverse_num(num):
  reverse_num=0


  #Reverse Number
  while(num>0):

    reverse_num = reverse_num*10 + num%10
    num = num // 10

  return reverse_num

def check_reverse(arr,x):
  reverse=0

  #Counter for array
  for i in range(x):
    for j in range(i+1,x):
    
      if(reverse_num(arr[i])==arr[j]):
        reverse+=1
  return reverse

if __name__ == '__main__':
  input_arr = [21,43,54,23,67,90,84,34,45,55,76,26,48]
  x=len(input_arr)
  print(check_reverse(input_arr,x))
